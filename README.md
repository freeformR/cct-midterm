In my implementation of the Cultural Consensus Theory, competence (D_i) followed a Uniform(0.5, 1) prior to reflect that informants are at least as accurate as random guessing. Consensus answers (Z_j) used a Bernoulli(0.5) prior, assuming no initial preference for either answer. The likelihood function linked responses to competence and consensus through a Bernoulli distribution, explicitly calculating response probabilities as pij = ZjDi + (1−Zj)(1−Di). Competence estimates varied significantly (0.56–0.87), with Informant #5 being most knowledgeable. Consensus answers showed high confidence for most items (e.g., Item 6 had a 99.8% posterior probability of being answered '1', and Items 7/19: >99% probability). Convergence was confirmed via R-hat = 1.0 and sufficient ESS values (>1,000), indicating reliable inferences. Five items (1, 5, 7, 9, 13) differed between CCT and majority vote. These discrepancies arose because CCT prioritizes high-competence informants’ responses. For example, Item 5’s majority vote was 0, but CCT selected 1, likely due to competent informants (#5, #6) favoring this answer. All of this highlights CCT’s advantage in leveraging expertise over simple aggregation.
